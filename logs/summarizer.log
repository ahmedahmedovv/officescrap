Title: Norway Seeks Strategic Partners for New Warship Program

Summary: The Norwegian Ministry of Defense announced on November 18th that it has invited France, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom to engage in strategic partnership talks for the frigate program. This initiative is a precursor to the acquisition of replacements for four Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates, which have been in service with the Norwegian Navy since 2006-2011. The potential partner countries for the new frigates include France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States. The acquisition of these new frigates will be the most expensive single purchase for the Norwegian Armed Forces in the future. As a significant maritime power within NATO, Norway considers the investment in its naval forces crucial for both its own security and that of its allies, stated Minister of Defense Bjørn Arild Gram. According to the long-term plan for the Norwegian Navy, five new oceanic frigates, with an option for an additional vessel, will be acquired. These ships will be equipped with helicopters capable of anti-submarine warfare. The selection of a "shortlist" of four potential strategic partners was made based on a comprehensive evaluation within the context of security policy. The new frigates are not intended to be purchased as standalone units but rather through a long-term and mutually beneficial strategic partnership with a close ally whose political interests align with those of Norway. This cooperation will encompass joint acquisition, operation, maintenance, continuous development, and modernization of the new frigates throughout their service life. To expedite the acquisition of these new frigates and mitigate the need for modernization of aging Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates, Oslo aims to accelerate this project by joining an existing program.

As of now, the specific types of frigates under consideration have not been disclosed. However, general indications, such as the country of origin and the possibility of adapting an existing project, provide some insight into the potential options.

For France, the options could include the interventional-defensive FDI frigate developed and manufactured by the Naval Group (selected by both the French and Greek navies). Alternatively, the larger and more versatile FREMM frigate could also be considered.

The United Kingdom may offer the Type 26 GCS (Global Combat Ship), developed by BAE Systems, which has been selected by the British, Canadian, and Australian navies, although in similar variants. Additionally, the Arrowhead 140, promoted by Babcock International Group and based on the proven Danish Iver Huitfeldt, could also be an option.

Germany may propose the MEKO 300 and 400 projects developed by thyssenkrupp Marine Systems. The latter has the potential to evolve into a future anti-aircraft frigate Klasse 127 for the German Navy.

The United States is currently developing the Constellation-class frigates, based on the Italian variation of the FREMM, designed by the Fincantieri group (which builds the American versions at its Marinette Marine subsidiary). It is also highly likely that Lockheed Martin will be the supplier of radar systems and combat management systems.
